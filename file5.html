            The first sport Rolex watch is the Submariner 5512.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-family: cursive"> The Oyster Perpetual Submariner is a reference among divers’ watches; 
            it is the watch that unlocked the deep.</h2>
        <p class="bg-blue">
                Launched in 1953, the Submariner was the first divers’ wristwatch waterproof 
                to a depth of 100 metres (330 feet). 
                This was the second great breakthrough in the technical mastery of waterproofness, 
                following the invention of the Oyster, the world’s first waterproof wristwatch, in 1926. 
                In watchmaking, the Submariner represented a historic turning point; 
                it set the standard for divers’ watches.
